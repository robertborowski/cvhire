POSSIBLE GREY AREA

-To avoid any issues of "extra pay" because of the giftcard, instead have a message that once someone has enough points to claim a giftcard prize, have a modal be recommended to them saying, we recommend you recieve your giftcard to your personal email address not work email. To avoid any legal complications that could be regarded as extra 'payment'

To-Do's

-#1 - The person who wins in the Slack message announcement is wrong. Robert won and it said it was Rob account. Email announcement of winner annouced the right person won. Something wrong with the Slack message bot sending part.
  - It is the part that looks at/inserts row "slack_message_sent_to_user_uuid_fk" column from/to the "triviafy_slack_messages_sent_table" table.
^^^
