-Job: If a quiz week ends, and there was No Winner on the result. That means that no one on the team got not 1 question right at all, or no one saw the quiz that week. BUT the quiz questions are marked as ASKED and now those questions can never be reasked to that team even though no one answered any correctly. That is a waste. So create a job that checks at the end of the week, is there 'no winner' for this week that just past? If so then delete the quiz altogether from quiz master table.
