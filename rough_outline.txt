POSSIBLE GREY AREA

-To avoid any issues of "extra pay" because of the giftcard, instead have a message that once someone has enough points to claim a giftcard prize, have a modal be recommended to them saying, we recommend you recieve your giftcard to your personal email address not work email. To avoid any legal complications that could be regarded as extra 'payment'
