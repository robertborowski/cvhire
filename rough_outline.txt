POSSIBLE GREY AREA

-To avoid any issues of "extra pay" because of the giftcard, instead have a message that once someone has enough points to claim a giftcard prize, have a modal be recommended to them saying, we recommend you recieve your giftcard to your personal email address not work email. To avoid any legal complications that could be regarded as extra 'payment'

=========================================
Send emails when:

-[DONE] Account Created
-New Quiz Is Up
-Latest Week's Quiz has been graded (Do this after you build the grading automation logic)
-Person who won the quiz for that week. Tell them how many more wins they need to get a gift-card

-Account Deleted (This is not priority, this is after you actually have customers signed up, they could alway email you if they want to be deleted)
