-Q01:What does "__init__.py" mean? And why is it located at almost every folder level that contains .py files
  -A01: The "__init__.py" file turns the desired folder into a "Python Package" which means that you can call from it like any other import (ex: import pandas as pd) same thing is possible because of __init__.py file.
