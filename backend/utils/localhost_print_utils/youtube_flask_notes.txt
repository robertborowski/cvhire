-Q01:What does "__init__.py" mean? And why is it located at almost every folder level that contains .py files
  -A01: The "__init__.py" file turns the desired folder into a "Python Package" which means that you can call from it like any other import (ex: import pandas as pd) same thing is possible because of __init__.py file.

-Q02: What is the purpose of the "templates" folder and structure as it relates to flask?
  -A02: the name templates is part of the special "templates language" within flask that allows you to insert "{{ example['something'] }}" python within html documents.
    - This functionality / "template language" is known as Jinja.
    -Jinja: Allows you to render user information on the page without having to use JavaScript, simple


-Jinja syntax options on the html page:
  -{%%}: When writing a block or writing 'pythonic' syntax [for loops, if statement, etc.] you put them inside -->: "{% code_goes_here %}" also for extends and blocks
  -{{}}: What this means is that we are going to write a python expression, ex: [variables, functions, some kind of python expression that returns a value]
  -"block": this means I am defining a block within the base.html (master html) template that can be overridden in a child template.
    -Children template inherit (Extend) the base template, so setting up a block for title allows every single page in the future to be able to have a different uniform space for their own title on their own page.
    -in essense you can "block" out space on your base.html (master.html) page that you know children (extended) pages will use as a blueprint/template for thier own specific page (about, faq, pricing, etc)

-url_for(): a python function that loads the url for the static folder. It finds that URL on our website
  -Example: <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='index.js') }}"></script>
