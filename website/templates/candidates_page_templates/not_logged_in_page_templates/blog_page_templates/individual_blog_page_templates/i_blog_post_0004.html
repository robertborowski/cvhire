    <p class="i-blog-paragraph-p i-blog-section-spacing-lg">This question is used to gauge a candidate’s enthusiasm for the role they are interviewing for and to get a better understanding of their motivations for applying. It is also a good way to understand what the candidate is looking for in a job and how their skills and interests might fit with the role. The candidate’s answer should provide insight into their understanding of the position and why they would be a good fit as well as their interest in the position.</p>

    <h2 class="i-blog-paragraph-p i-blog-section-spacing">3. Describe your current job responsibilities.</h2>
    <p class="i-blog-paragraph-p i-blog-section-spacing-lg">This is designed to get an overview of the type of work that a candidate is currently doing.

    <h2 class="i-blog-paragraph-p i-blog-section-spacing">10. Is there anything you would like to ask me about the role or company?</h2>
    <p class="i-blog-paragraph-p i-blog-section-spacing-lg">This question is typically asked at the end of an interview to give the candidate a chance to ask any further questions they may have about the job or the company.
