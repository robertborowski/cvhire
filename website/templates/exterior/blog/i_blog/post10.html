    <p>Job hunting inevitably involves some sort of resume screening software. Within Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), these software solutions are changing the way recruiters and companies evaluate potential candidates.</p>
    <p>Even though your resume is up to date and showcases your expertise and experience, your callback rate for interviews remains disappointingly low. The reason? More often than not, your resume is initially being evaluated by an algorithm rather than a real person.</p>

    <h2 class="css-header-25 css-weight-bolder css-mb-25">Understanding the Role of ATS in Recruitment</h2>
    <p>An ATS is essentially a digital recruiter, sifting through countless resumes to identify those that most closely align with the job requirements. These automated tools collect, sort, and rank resumes based on specific criteria, such as keywords, skills, previous job titles, and educational background.</p>
    <p>For job seekers, this means that understanding and optimizing your resume for these automated AI systems is critical. The perfect resume is not just one that impresses a hiring manager but one that an ATS can also parse effectively.</p>
