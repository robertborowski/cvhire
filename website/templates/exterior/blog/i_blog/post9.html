    <p>Job hunting inevitably involves some sort of resume screening software. Within Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), these software solutions are changing the way recruiters and companies evaluate potential candidates.</p>
    <p>Even though your resume is up to date and showcases your expertise and experience, your callback rate for interviews remains disappointingly low. The reason? More often than not, your resume is initially being evaluated by an algorithm rather than a real person.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="css-mb-50">
    <h2 class="css-header-25 css-weight-bolder css-mb-25">Understanding the Role of ATS in Recruitment</h2>
    <p>An ATS is essentially a digital recruiter, sifting through countless resumes to identify those that most closely align with the job requirements. These automated tools collect, sort, and rank resumes based on specific criteria, such as keywords, skills, previous job titles, and educational background.</p>
    <p>For job seekers, this means that understanding and optimizing your resume for these automated AI systems is critical. The perfect resume is not just one that impresses a hiring manager but one that an ATS can also parse effectively.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="css-mb-50">
    <h2 class="css-header-25 css-weight-bolder css-mb-25">How Does an ATS Work?</h2>
    <p>An ATS can be broken down as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A job requisition is uploaded into the ATS, detailing the position's requirements.</li>
      <li>Candidate resumes are submitted and analyzed by the ATS, which ranks them according to relevance and qualifications.</li>
      <li>Recruiters review the top ranked resumes that the ATS presents.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main takeaway for applicants is the importance of tailoring resumes to include the right mix of keywords and job specific phrases that the company is looking for in that role.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="css-mb-50">
    <h2 class="css-header-25 css-weight-bolder css-mb-25">ATS vs. CRM: The Tools of Talent Acquisition</h2>
    <p>While ATS is designed for managing candidates and applications, Candidate Relationship Management (CRM) systems are tailored for building up a talent pool. CRMs are proactive tools in recruitment, allowing companies to engage with potential candidates before they even apply. Tools include <a href="https://beamery.com/" class="css-a-black-underline-on" target="_blank">Beamery</a>, <a href="https://www.avature.net/" class="css-a-black-underline-on" target="_blank">Avature</a>, and <a href="https://www.greenhouse.com/" class="css-a-black-underline-on" target="_blank">greenhouse</a>.</p>
    <p>Recruiters often leverages both systems, using ATS for its efficiency in processing applications and CRM for its outreach and relationship building with potential candidates.</p>
