    <p>In the world of recruitment, efficiency and speed are essential. Recruiters deal with the sifting through resumes to find the perfect candidate. This is where resume parsing comes into play. But what exactly is resume parsing, and how does a CV/resume parser work? Let's dive into the details.</p>

  <div class="css-mb-50">
    <h2 class="css-header-25 css-weight-bolder css-mb-25">Understanding Resume Parsing</h2>
    <p>Resume parsing is the process where a resume parser, an advanced software tool, extracts data from a resume and converts it into a structured format. Essentially, a resume parser scans the text from an unstructured form, like a Word document or a PDF, and translates it into a format that can be easily managed by a computer, such as XML or JSON. This automated process not only saves time but also enhances the accuracy with which recruiters can analyze the candidate.</p>

    <p>At its core, a resume parser is built on a deep learning/AI framework.

Once the data is extracted, the resume parsing software grades the potential candidates for quick and effective hiring decisions.</p>
