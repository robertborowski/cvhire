    <p>A recruitment system is more than just a set of disconnected tools, it's an integrated platform that supports all stages of the hiring process. Recruitment systems should offer comprehensive workflows, analytics to track recruitment metrics, and the flexibility to adapt to your company's changing needs.</p>
