Artificial intelligence (AI) can help recruiters be more productive in their role. AI-powered recruitment tools help to automate many of the time-consuming tasks involved in the recruitment process, such as resume parsing, candidate screening, and interview scheduling. AI tools can free up recruiters time to focus on more strategic tasks, such as building relationships with candidates and making more informed hiring decisions.</p>
