  <p class="custom-header-30 fw-bolder custom-mt-50">Fan Feedback on Huberman Lab - The Hate (Cons)</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">1. "I was really excited to listen to the Huberman Lab podcast, but I was disappointed by how much bro-science and guru-science he peddles. He's always quick to recommend supplements and other lifestyle changes, but he never seems to be skeptical of the evidence. It's like he's just trying to sell me stuff too much."</li>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">2. "I feel like I'm being taken for a ride every time I listen to the Huberman Lab podcast. He makes all these claims about how he can help you optimize your health and performance, but I think he's way too quick to make sweeping generalizations."</li>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">3. "I'm a PhD student in neuroscience, and I was really disappointed by the quality of the science on the Huberman Lab podcast because he often cites small, preliminary studies as if they were definitive evidence. And he's always recommending supplements too."</li>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">4. "I used to be a big fan of the Huberman Lab podcast, but I've gotten really turned off by how much he's been pushing his own supplements. It feels like he's more interested in making money than in actually helping people. I'm not saying that his supplements are bad, but I think it's partially unethical for him to be promoting them on his podcast about health."</li>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">5. "I listened to the Huberman Lab podcast on aging, and I was really disappointed. He made all these claims about how you can reverse aging, but there evidence is weak in my opinion. I think he's just preying on people's fears of aging on that episode."</li>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">6. "I'm really disappointed in Stanford for allowing Dr. Huberman to use his platform to promote his own supplements. It's a clear conflict of interest, and it's not fair to his listeners. I want to know what Stanford thinks about this."</li>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">7. "I'm not sure if Dr. Huberman is just naive or if he's deliberately misleading his listeners, but he's definitely making a lot of money off of his podcast. He's constantly promoting his own supplements, and he's even started selling his own line of clothing. It is a blurry line to be profiting off of his listeners' who care about health topics."</li>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">8. "Dr. Huberman is just another Dr. Oz. He's using his credentials to market self-help BS, and he's not above making unsubstantiated claims. I hope that people will take his podcast episodes with a huge grain of salt."</li>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">9. "I'm really tired of the whole 'self-optimization' movement. It's based on the idea that we're all not good enough, and that we need to take supplements and change our lifestyles in order to be happy and successful. I think it's a toxic message."</li>
    <li class="custom-header-20 custom-mb-15">10. "I'm a PhD student in developmental psychology, and I was really disappointed by the podcast on ADHD. Dr. Huberman made a lot of unsubstantiated claims, and he didn't seem to be familiar with the latest research. I think he's doing a disservice to people with ADHD by giving them advice."</li>
